# Yurisploit

This github displays the current scripts that are available to the public.

Currently HBE is payed for and isnt free, unlike the gripper.

The gripper is equiped with a much weaker security base as well as less lines for the script as it is currently in experimental mode! I salute to the anti-exploit team that trys to patch this daily!
